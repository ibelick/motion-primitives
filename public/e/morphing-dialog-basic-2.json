A year later,\n                    he’d completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon, and\n                    now, after dozens of such races, not to mention triathlons\n                    and a dozen critically acclaimed books, he reflects upon the\n                    influence the sport has had on his life and—even more\n                    important—on his writing.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Equal parts training log, travelogue, and reminiscence, this\n                    revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the\n                    2005 New York City Marathon and takes us to places ranging\n                    from Tokyo’s Jingu Gaien gardens, where he once shared the\n                    course with an Olympian, to the Charles River in Boston\n                    among young women who outpace him. Through this marvelous\n                    lens of sport emerges a panorama of memories and insights:\n                    the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer, his\n                    greatest triumphs and disappointments, his passion for\n                    vintage LPs, and the experience, after fifty, of seeing his\n                    race times improve and then fall back.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, What\n                    I Talk About When I Talk About Running is rich and\n                    revelatory, both for fans of this masterful yet guardedly\n                    private writer and for the exploding population of athletes\n                    who find similar satisfaction in running.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </ScrollArea>\n          <MorphingDialogClose className='text-zinc-500' />\n        </MorphingDialogContent>\n      </MorphingDialogContainer>\n    </MorphingDialog>\n  );\n}\n",
