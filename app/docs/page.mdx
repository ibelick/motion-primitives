# Motion-Primitives

Make your website look better with beautifully designed motion components.<br />
Easy to use. Customizable. Open Source.
Built for engineers, designers, and founders.

Motion-Primitives offers a collection of reusable animated components built with Motion and Tailwind CSS. Add smooth, engaging animations to your web projects, making them more interactive and enjoyable.

## Vision

As a developer, I struggled to find practical, high-quality animated components suitable for real-world projects. Motion-Primitives was created to fill this gap, providing ready-to-use, customizable components that improve marketing websites and web applications.

### Easy to Use and customize

Each component has comprehensive examples and detailed documentation. You can use them directly or easily modify them to align with your custom UI kit, design system, or specific requirements.

### Built around Motion

All components are built with [Motion](https://motion.dev/) to ensure a solid foundation and showcase the library's capabilities. Future plans include versions using CSS and Tailwind CSS only.

### Open source and community-driven

Motion-Primitives is open-source. Contributions are welcome to expand and improve the collection.
